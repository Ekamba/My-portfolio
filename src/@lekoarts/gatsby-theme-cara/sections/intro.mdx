# Hi, I'm Axel Leonide Gassay Ekamba

I have learned why I truly love programming, that immense satisfaction you get from developing something real, that makes the customer's life easier. I have developed excellent user experiences in MERN, with clean code and well-tested. Furthermore, I'm currently looking to contribute my skills to a team where I can prove my skills while growing in my capabilities. If you are looking for a competent, highly motivated developer, let's chat.
